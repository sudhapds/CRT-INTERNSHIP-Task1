**TASK 1 : SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA DATA**

**Description:**
•	Build a sentiment analysis model to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Steps:**
1.	Data Collection: Gather a dataset of social media posts with labeled sentiments.
2.	Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
3.	Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
4.	Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or a neural network.
5.	Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
6.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7.	Deployment: Create a simple web interface where users can input their own text for sentiment analysis.

**Tech Stack:**
•	Python
•	Natural Language Processing libraries 
•	Machine Learning frameworks
